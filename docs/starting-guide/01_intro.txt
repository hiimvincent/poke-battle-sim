The starting guide includes:

- Battle Setup: How to set up different parts of a Battle

- Battle Simulation: How to simulate battles

- Battle Checks: How to check whether turn actions are valid

- Randomization: How to randomize battles

If you are still unsure  about how to use the package after reading the starting guide, please check out the poke-battle-sim example project.

Battle Simulation

Once a Battle is created, it must be started using the start function.

Ex. first_battle.start()

After the Battle has been started, Trainers may begin to perform actions in the battle including telling their current Pokemon to use a move, switching out their current Pokemon, or using an item from their bag. These actions are communicated through the turn function.

Both trainers are required to provide a valid action for a turn to be processed.

The three types of valid actions are:
Moves - formatted as ['move', $move_name]
Items - formatted as ['item', $item, $item_target_pos, $move_target_name?]
Switch-out - formatted as ['other', 'switch']


Certain moves and switching out will call the respective trainer's selection function.

If either trainer provides an invalid action, the turn will abort and an exception will be raised.

Ex. first_battle.turn(t1_turn=[‘move’, ‘thunderbolt’], t2_turn=[‘other’, ‘switch’])

The battle will continue to accept turns until all of a Trainer’s Pokemon faint and a winner is determined. To see if a battle is over, it may be useful to call the get_winner or is_finished functions.

get_winner: will return the victorious Trainer if the battle has finished and None if the battle is ongoing.

Ex. winner_optional = not battle.get_winner()

is_finished: will return True if the battle has finished and False if the battle is still ongoing

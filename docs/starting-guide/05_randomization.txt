Randomization

If you are interested in performing randomized simulations of Pokemon battles, there are several useful methods in the PokeSim class (where the csv data is processed). 

Moves:

get_rand_move: gives random move within the move csv

Ex. r_move = PokeSim.get_rand_move()

Abilities:

get_rand_ability: gives random ability within the ability csv

Ex. r_ability = PokeSim.get_rand_ability()

Items:

get_rand_item: gives random item within the item csv

Ex. r_item = PokeSim.get_rand_item()

Pokemon:

get_rand_poke_id: gives random Pokemon id within Pokemon csv

Ex. r_poke_id = PokeSim.get_rand_poke_id()

Stats:

get_rand_stats: gives random stat list within allowed stat range

Ex. r_stats = PokeSim.get_rand_stats()

Gender:

get_rand_gender: gives random gender within defined possible genders

Ex. r_gender = PokeSim.get_rand_gender()

Level:

get_rand_level: gives random level within allowed level range

Ex. r_level = PokeSim.get_rand_level()

Nature:

get_rand_nature: gives random nature within the natures csv

Ex. r_nature = PokeSim.get_rand_nature()

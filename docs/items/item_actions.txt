Item Actions

This document explains the item system in poke-battle-sim and how to correctly format item actions during a battle turn.

Although using items is not allowed in the original games’ traditional link battles, poke-battle-sim includes this optional mechanic for npc battles or customized battles.

Only items that can be used in battle in the Gen IV games are able to be used in poke-battle-sim. In addition, like the original games, items that will have no effect in a certain situation, such as using a Potion on a Pokemon with full health are also not able to used.

You can check whether a Trainer can use an item on a specific Pokemon using the can_use_item function.

*Note that poke-battle-sim does not track a Trainer’s inventory, meaning it may be necessary to check whether the Trainer actually has the item they are attempting to use.

In order to use the can_use_item function and to actually use an item during a turn, an item action must be constructed correctly.

An item action can consist of either three of four parts.

Item actions are formatted as: ['item', $item, $item_target_pos, $move_target_name?]

‘Item’ indicates that the Trainer is attempting to use an item.

$item indicates the name of the item, such as ‘hyper-potion’

$item_target_pos indicates the position of the item target (zero-indexed), meaning the item_target_pos would be 1 if you attempt to use an item on the second Pokemon in your party.

*Position is used instead of name or id to avoid duplicate collisions

$move_target_name is only used when an item targets a single move and indicates the position of the move in the target Pokemon’s move list (also zero-indexed).
